This is a work in progress group messaging web app built with kotlin and Svelte running on top of a PostgreSql db. There's some more documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/Stugeh/bantt/wiki).

## Tech stack:

### Web client
* **Typescript**
* **Sveltekit**
* **TailwindCSS**

### Server
* **Kotlin**
* **PostgreSql**
* **Ktor**
    * A light weight backend framework built exclusively for Kotlin as opposed to something like spring.
* **Exposed**
    * facilitates the interaction between the db and the rest of the backend.
